      How to Self Host MyVerify:
      
Cool! You want to Self Host MyVerify! Here are a few things you need to know:

- You MUST have a basic knowledge on how to use NPM and node.js. 
- You must know a very small amount of JavaScript to do this.

1. Please use the normal procedures on making a DISCORD bot. Use NPM and then once you have made all the files, create an index.js file.
2. Open the index.js file above and when you are on it, there is a small button called "RAW". Click the button.
3. You should have been redirected. Please press "CTRL + A" or with mac: "CMD + A". Then press "CTRL + C" or with mac: "CMD + C".
4. Now go to the index.js file you made on your folder on your bot and press "CTRL + V" or with mac: "CMD + V".

      Enjoy your new bot! To turn it on, go to the terminal and type: `node .`
